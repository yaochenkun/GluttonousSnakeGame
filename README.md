## Environment and Settings
* Download and install VC++6.0.
* Download and install [EasyX库 2012立冬版](http://www.easyx.cn/downloads/View.aspx?id=6). (If you cannot visit the download link, this repository has also provided the installation package, and you can just download from here.)
* Compile the source code file 'xxx.cpp' by VC, and then you can run and play the game.

## Key Points
* Design __a linked list__ to store the coordinate of snake's body node.
* Recognize the __direction__ (up,down,left and right) of snake and decide the snake's __head coordinate__.
* Implement the __animation__ of snake's moving.
